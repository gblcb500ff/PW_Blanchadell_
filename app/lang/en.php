"VentajasDesventajas"=>"Advantages and disadvantages of using aluminium in shipbuilding.",
"Durabilidad" => "Durability",
"TextoVD1"=>"Aluminium is more resistant to knocks and scratches. Only an enormous blow could cause a possible dent in the hull. It is more resistant to salt water corrosion, but galvanic or electrolytic corrosion can be avoided with a well insulated electrical installation and sacrificial anodes. They last longer than GRP or fibreglass boats.",
"Peso"=>"Weight",
"TextoVD2"=>"Aluminium is a lighter material than fibre, this makes the construction of an aluminium boat a lighter boat, therefore it will be a faster boat and will need less engine power to move the same metres as a fibre boat, which also leads to a more fuel efficient boat.",
"Manejabilidad"=>"Handling",
"TextoVD2"=>"Fibre boats being heavier are also more stable and solid at higher speeds and when the sea state starts to get rough and choppy. An aluminium boat at high speeds can feel more nervous and rough in rough seas.",
"Confort"=>"Comfort",
"TextoVD3"=>"Aluminium boats are noisier than fibre boats, especially at high speeds and in rough seas. Aluminium is a better temperature transmitter and therefore, if not well insulated in its construction with a thick layer of polyurethane or other insulation, it will be warmer in warm places and colder in winter. Also aluminium boats suffer more from condensation problems than fibre boats. Therefore a fibre boat can be somewhat more comfortable than an aluminium boat.",
"Mantenimiento"=>"Maintenance",
"TextoVD4"=>"Aluminium boats require more maintenance due to corrosion. One problem to watch out for is galvanic material pairs, a corrosion effect that occurs when pieces of different metals are joined together. We must be careful with the quality of any part or screw that we use because it could cause us a serious problem. The boat should also be cleaned thoroughly with fresh water after each use.",
"Reparaciones"=>"Repairs",
"TextoVD5"=>"Small dents in an aluminium boat are easy to repair but when the damage is to large areas of the hull, repairs are more difficult and expensive than on fibreglass boats. Aluminium welding is a very specialised and complicated job, finding trained professionals to repair fibreglass is easier and cheaper. However, a large partial repair on a fibre hull does not guarantee the original strength as the structural stress will no longer be the same at all points.",
"Estética"=>"Aesthetics",
"TextoVD6"=>"The surface finish of the aluminium boats leaves traces of the interior reinforcements.",
"Seguridad"=>"Safety",
"TextoVD7"=>"Contrary to what we may think, aluminium burns. It is true that GRP burns earlier and more easily, so in the event of a fire, an aluminium boat will always be safer. Fibreglass or GRP boats are built with petroleum products and are therefore combustible. Also, in the event of an impact with a rock, it is easier to make a leak in a fibre boat than in an aluminium boat.",
"ValorResidual"=>"Residual value",
"TextoVD8"=>"The wear and tear of a fibre boat is greater over the years, exposure to sunlight and osmosis do not affect aluminium boats. They are also more resistant to fouling by algae and marine crustaceans. The greater rigidity and structural strength also makes aluminium boats more resistant to ageing and therefore they depreciate less than fibre boats.",
"Coste"=>"Cost",
"TextoVD9"=>"Fibre boats allow mass production from a first mould or design, which leads to faster production and lower construction costs.",
